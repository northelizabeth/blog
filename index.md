Dear Peer, 

I'm glad you are here. Please have a look around to see some projects I have worked on over the years. These are purely passion, learning and interest projects. To quote my first content analysis master's course professor when I was 22 - _"why is it always some global social issue with you?"_  
Or my first computer science professor, a C++ course when I was 19, _"you'll never be able to think like a coder."_ (In the context of me being a woman).

I dedicate this presentation of learnings to these two men.

Cheers,  
Elizabeth
