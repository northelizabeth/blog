Hi there, 

I'm glad you are here. Please have a look around to see some projects I have worked on over the years. These are purely passion, learning and interest projects. All work here is open access for an individual user - just cite the blog post where you found it. If you need help using any code, you can ask by email.

I hope you find something that inspires you!

Cheers,  
Elizabeth
