Hi there, 

Welcome, and thanks for stopping by. Here you will find some hobby, learning, and interest projects I have worked on over the years. All my work is open access for an individual user - just cite the blog post where you find it. If you need help using some code, you can ask by email.

Perhaps you might find something that inspires you!

Cheers,  
Elizabeth
