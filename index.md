Dear Earthling, 

I'm glad you are here. Please have a look around to see some projects I have worked on over the years. To quote the professor of my first ever content analysis master's course when I was 22 - "why is it always some heavy social issue with you?"

Or my first computer science professor who should have been teaching me C++ when I was 19, "you'll never be able to think like a coder." (In the context of me being a woman).

I dedicate this presentation of learnings to these two men.

Cheers,

Elizabeth
